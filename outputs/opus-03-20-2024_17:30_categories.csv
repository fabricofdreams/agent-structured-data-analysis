The 6 main categories I identified based on analyzing the purchased items are:

1. Health & Wellness - includes expenses like dental check-ups, prescription drugs, vitamins, first aid 
2. Entertainment - covers movie tickets, music, video games, streaming services
3. Education - contains textbooks, online learning, educational software and materials 
4. Food & Grocery - encompasses meat, produce, baked goods, dairy and other groceries
5. Fitness - includes gym memberships, workout clothes/gear, fitness classes, sports equipment 
6. Personal Care - covers haircuts, makeup, skin care products, hygiene items

I tried to group related products together in a way that made logical sense and would allow for targeted analysis and marketing. The categories and product groupings cover the breadth of items found in the expense data.
